### Contributions
My contributions within the project involved setting up the backend and connecting it to the frontend. My team wasn't as experienced as me so I helped provide a 
structure for the team to start with. I set up the express app and the different routes that we use for fetching our data for the frontend to display. 
We decided to use MongoDB and express which I had the most experience in so I helped teach my teammates and explain the process between the frontend, backend 
and our database. Furthermore, I worked on data scrapping in order to obtain club info from shoreline and save that data into our mongo
database. I also worked on maintaining data from user, so signup info, login info and bookmarks for user. I also worked on keeping track of the features that you can access if you are logged or not. I also worked on deployment of heroku.
