My contributions to this project were mostly on important features. In the beginning I set up most of the frontend features including search bar, navigation bar, and a dropdown
menu. Although most of them are hard coded, it gave a general direction of our product. 
In the middle I worked on testing, including several unit tests and some integration tests. Additionally, I also created a component test for our search bar that shows
the search bar is correctly rendering the page if we click on one of the clubs.
I also worked on filtering the bubbles so that the users can find the clubs they are interested more easily.
Currently I am working on the comment section, which allows the users to leave comments on what they think about the club.
Although I didn't commit a lot to Github since I prefer to finish everything and get everything to work before committing, most of my commits are larger features of our app.
