For me, I worked on the frontend general layout of the Home and Profile pages as well as indivudal features of each Club page. My first task was implementing a Favorite button where users can favorite a club they find interesting and have it linked to their Profile page. Later, I began working on the Review sections for each club. My initial review section was later updated by Morgan so that we could fit this feature with individual user profiles. After all the club bubbles were displayed on the Home Page, I was tasked with making these bubbles more visually appealing to viewers. I utilized grid and gridTemplateColumns so that we can have a more even spacing and layout for the bubbles. Each row has 4 bubbles instead of the initial 8 and there are now club names attached to each bubble underneath. Some clubs do not have their names displayed on their logo, so users would be confused as to which organization they would be viewing. Currently, I am working on an Edit Profile section where users can either change their name or email and have that displayed within their Profile Page.
