| Christine | My contributions to this project were mostly pair programming with others, and fixing small issues, fixing issues with github, and finding bugs in our website. In the beginning I uploaded the club banner image for data science and fixed team members errors with github, in the middle I worked on testing and the user manual and design document, managing the Kanban Board and helping with comments, and at the end of the project I have been working on user manual and finding bugs along the way, and fixing some or reporting to the rest of the team the errors I cannot fix, so that we have a fully functioning app before our code freeze. I feel like although I had the most commits on the team, my team did much more technical work than me. |
|  Morgan   | My contributions to this project were mostly on important features. In the beginning I set up most of the frontend features including search bar, navigation bar, and a dropdown
menu. Although most of them are hard coded, it gave a general direction of our product. 
In the middle I worked on testing, including several unit tests and some integration tests. Additionally, I also created a component test for our search bar that shows
the search bar is correctly rendering the page if we click on one of the clubs.
I also worked on filtering the bubbles so that the users can find the clubs they are interested more easily.
Currently I am working on the comment section, which allows the users to leave comments on what they think about the club.
Although I didn't commit a lot to Github since I prefer to finish everything and get everything to work before committing, most of my commits are larger features of our app. Also, for some reason, it shows that I have 2 accounts with the same name and one of them does not show on the actual graph, which is the reason why my commits graph fell exponentially after MVP. |
