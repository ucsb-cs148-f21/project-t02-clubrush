| Christine | My contributions to this project were mostly pair programming with others, and fixing small issues, fixing issues with github, and finding bugs in our website. In the beginning I uploaded the club banner image for data science and fixed team members errors with github, in the middle I worked on testing and the user manual and design document, managing the Kanban Board and helping with comments, and at the end of the project I have been working on user manual and finding bugs along the way, and fixing some or reporting to the rest of the team the errors I cannot fix, so that we have a fully functioning app before our code freeze. I feel like although I had the most commits on the team, my team did much more technical work than me. |
|  Morgan   | My contributions to this project were mostly on important features. In the beginning I set up most of the frontend features including search bar, navigation bar, and a dropdown
menu. Although most of them are hard coded, it gave a general direction of our product. 
In the middle I worked on testing, including several unit tests and some integration tests. Additionally, I also created a component test for our search bar that shows
the search bar is correctly rendering the page if we click on one of the clubs.
I also worked on filtering the bubbles so that the users can find the clubs they are interested more easily.
Currently I am working on the comment section, which allows the users to leave comments on what they think about the club.
Although I didn't commit a lot to Github since I prefer to finish everything and get everything to work before committing, most of my commits are larger features of our app. Also, for some reason, it shows that I have 2 accounts with the same name and one of them does not show on the actual graph, which is the reason why my commits graph fell exponentially after MVP. |

|  Robert   | For me, I worked on the frontend general layout of the Home and Profile pages as well as indivudal features of each Club page. My first task was implementing a Favorite button where users can favorite a club they find interesting and have it linked to their Profile page. Later, I began working on the Review sections for each club. My initial review section was later updated by Morgan so that we could fit this feature with individual user profiles. After all the club bubbles were displayed on the Home Page, I was tasked with making these bubbles more visually appealing to viewers. I utilized grid and gridTemplateColumns so that we can have a more even spacing and layout for the bubbles. Each row has 4 bubbles instead of the initial 8 and there are now club names attached to each bubble underneath. Some clubs do not have their names displayed on their logo, so users would be confused as to which organization they would be viewing. After I completed all these tasks, Tommy and Morgan helped to integrate it within the backend. I also worked on an Edit Profile section, but due to lack of time, we were unable to incorporate that within our project. Everytime I finished a new feature, I committed and pushed it to my branch. |
