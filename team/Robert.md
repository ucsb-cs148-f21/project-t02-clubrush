# About Me
Hi! My name is Robert He and I am currently a third year Computer Science major. 
# Project Ideas
My ideas for the project involve a more easily accessible and user-friendly page, in contrast to the current Shoreline page. The layout will be simple and minimalistic; the vision is to have it Isla Vista themed (with the sunset, beach, lagoon, etc.). There will be drop down windows for each organization category (fraternity, academic, cultural, etc.) and drop down windows for those to give out more specific options (fraternity -> cultural, social, professional, etc.). Follwing Simon Sinek's "Golden Circle" Rule, I want to have organizations explain what their mission and values are, how they go about to achieve that, and most importantly why people should join their organization.
