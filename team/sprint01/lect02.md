# Scribed Discussion: 
Goal: <br />
- To help students find their community within UCSB and further their connections <br />
- As much as it seems, 4 years is not a long time. Many times, it’s difficult for people to find a community that is right for them. At UCSB, though there are numerous club involvement fairs and daily organization tablings, it’s difficult for people to fit an organization that is the right fit for them as they don’t know what the organization is about, their mission, values, events, and vibe. <br />
- Greek Life, especially, is hard to keep track of. Their names revolve around the greek alphabet, so it is even harder to distinguish their goals, mission, and such just from the title of their names <br />
- In contrast to Shoreline, the Club Rush application is open to all members of SB (SBCC, SB residents, graduate students, and such), not just UCSB undergraduate students to help others find a sense of community <br />
- There are alot of clubs and people can get overwhelmed, we can create a responsive and easy to use webapp in order to convey different clubs mission and values <br />
