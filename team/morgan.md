# About me
My name is Morgan and I'm a 3rd year Computer Science Major. 

# Project Ideas
For this project, I'm thinking of creating a webpage, introducing all the clubs and fraternities, and helping fellow Gauchos to find a place where they belong and enjoy their years at UCSB!

To do so, I think we can provide detailed descriptions for each clubs and frats, as well as posting upcoming events so students could know what's happening or whatever they're interested in joining. Additionally, this is not only restricted to UCSB students. Visitors from SBCC or even residents can also navigate on this webpage and find their communites.
