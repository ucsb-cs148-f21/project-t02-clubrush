TO-DO before friday: <br />
- our Club page scrapes "Mission <asdjfhasdkjlfhasdkjhfaj>"
- and contact for clubs is still displayed as: "contact@gmail.com" <link to datasci web page> (even though its a different club - SB Hacks) 
- dropdown menu has a random "clubs" tag that we need to change
- Bookmark and edit profile not connected to backend **bookmark should be fine for demo purposes but the edit email and name**
- Comments name and pic
- "Bookmarks" bar and "Profile" in navbar conflict when you sign in
- Once you sign in theres both a Profile and a Bookmarks page that show different pages - profile has the doggy page and the email is a random number - "61a7f8797b5ce72f1517da90"
- search bar on the club pages, when u click the club you're searching for it opens up a new page and when you search for another bar and click, then it says "This page is not found"
