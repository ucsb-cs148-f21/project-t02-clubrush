# About Me
Hi! My name is Christine Ong and I'm a third year CS major. :)
# Project Ideas
An idea I have for the project is formatting the website to have different
pages organizing the clubs from Educational, to Music, to Sports, to Professional
and having sub-categories. Another idea I have is to have the Club photo followed
by the club Name and a space for the description following it.
