### User Journey

* As a first year at UCSB, I can better search for organizations that match my values and interests so that I can find the right community for me here at UCSB.
* As a busy student, I can find out what the club does and what it focuses on so that I donâ€™t have to physically present to their meetings and know what they are doing.
* As an introvert student looking for friends, I can use this app to find clubs that interest me so that I could meet new people that have the same interests as me.
* As a student who is interested in joining fraternities but doesn't really know which one to join, I can distinguish their goals, mission, and such from the description on the app so that it would be easier for me to know which organization fits me.
