## Retro Assessment

* For this retro we use the start/stop/continue outline to assess our strengths and weaknesses and how to work through these in the future.
* It was very constructive and helpful to setting up our team responsibilities, and will allow us to work better and more efficiently as a team.
* Advice I would give to the next person leading the retro is to assess the progress of the project

## Retro Outcome Assessment

* Our retro 1 experiment was to set team roles and divide up work properly.
* The metric we planned on using was seeing progress on our web app development vs. how we performed before.
* The outcome is great, there has not been much conflict, and where others have trouble or difficulty, team members are always willing to step up and help, regardless of role distribution.
* The outcome was great, so we are choosing to continue following these roles we have set for ourselves continuing on.
