## Retro Assessment
* For this retro we use the start/stop/continue to see what we are lacking in and what we can improve on.
* It was very helpful as we got to collectively share our ideas and issues, helping us work better together as a team and giving this product value.
* Advice I would give to the next person leading the retro is make sure that everyone has done their work and make sure that everyone is on track. If anyone falls behind, try to bring that out during the retro. 

## Retro Outcome Assessment

* Our retro 3 experiment was to finish up the app and implementing more features given the limited time. 
* The metric we planned on using was making sure that everyone is on track and see if anyone needs help with anything so people who have finished their tasks could help.
* The outcome is looking positive. People are on task and working hard towards the project. Things are getting done and there hasn't been a lot of conflict, so it's good. 
* With this outcome, I can say that our team progress will continue to look bright as long as we continue this habit of setting deadlines.
