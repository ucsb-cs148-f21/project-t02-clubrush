# About Me
I am a 3rd year computer sceince major that has an interest in Web Development.

# Project Ideas
For this project, I think that we can create a clean and sleek web app where a different groups and clubs are displayed on the Web App. Each group/club displays different information that the user can see. This info contains detailed information on the group/club mission, what they do, and what its like to be in their community.
I also think that the user can bookmark clubs and recieve notifications of their clubs.
