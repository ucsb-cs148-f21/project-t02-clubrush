# Personas

## Persona 1
Timmy is a freshman at UCSB and has only met a couple of his floor-mates at the dorms he is living in, but he still wants to meet more people outside of the dorms. Timmy feels that he is stuck at the dorms and doesn't know where to find different events. Then Timmy discovers our Club Rush webapp, which allows him to see all the events that groups are hosting, as well as search for specific groups that peeks his interest. He finds an Ultimate Frisbee club, which he loves to play. He also finds a Data Science club, where he can seek advice for his major. Club rush allows him to solve his problems of finding their strong community and group of friends, especially at a place where you barely know anyone. He can easily search for groups that he feels he would strive and feel more at home here at UCSB. The Club Rush app can feature bookmarking groups so that Timmy can be up-to-date with his groups of interest.

## Persona 2
Kevin Chang is a college freshman looking for friends. He decides to join some clubs but he doesn't know where to start. He wants to know what each club does, hoping to find his community. 

# Goals
- To help students find their community within UCSB and further their connections <br />
- As much as it seems, 4 years is not a long time. Many times, it’s difficult for people to find a community that is right for them. At UCSB, though there are numerous club involvement fairs and daily organization tablings, it’s difficult for people to fit an organization that is the right fit for them as they don’t know what the organization is about, their mission, values, events, and vibe. <br />
- Greek Life, especially, is hard to keep track of. Their names revolve around the greek alphabet, so it is even harder to distinguish their goals, mission, and such just from the title of their names <br />
- In contrast to Shoreline, the Club Rush application is open to all members of SB (SBCC, SB residents, graduate students, and such), not just UCSB undergraduate students to help others find a sense of community <br />
- There are alot of clubs and people can get overwhelmed, we can create a responsive and easy to use webapp in order to convey different clubs mission and values <br />


# Problems
- Retrieving relevant data to show user
- Learning how to scrap data from Shoreline
- Figuring out what to develop with, what is our technical stack
- Figuring out the organzation of clubs to display to user


# Subproblems
- Website needs to be up  
- buttons?
- dropdowns?
- image uploads for clubs
- description formatting
- categorizing clubs + organizing
- user friendly font and formatting 
- have a home bar that has the drop downs and maybe and image that links back to the home page of the website
- When people first step foot into UCSB, everyone is scared of not being able to find their strong community or group of friends, especially at a place where you barely know anyone.
- With this Club Rush site, people will be able to more effectively navigate through all the potential clubs and communities there is for one to join, with a more minimal and simplistic site.
