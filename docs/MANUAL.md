# Product Purpose
For many students at UCSB, it's difficult to find a community here in college, especially because it is a new environment away from home. There is not a central repository of information about UCSB clubs so we believe creating a website like this can benefit a lot of students at UCSB. Shoreline is a common way of finding clubs at UCSB; however, it has a lot of unnecessary components and features that are inconvenient to navigate. With our website, we want to offer a more simplistic and minimal looking site so that it includes only the important information about clubs such as description, mission, contact information, and social media pages. Itâ€™s something freshman, transfers, and even new graduate students can all benefit from. Overall, we just want to make the search for clubs here at UCSB much easier for people.
