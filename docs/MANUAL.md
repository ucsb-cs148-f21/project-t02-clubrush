# Product Purpose
For many students at UCSB, it's difficult to find their community here in college. Especially since it’s a new environment far away from home. There isn’t a central repository of information about UCSB clubs so we thought creating a site like this could really benefit a lot of people. Shoreline is a common way of finding clubs here at Ucsb, but it has a lot of unnecessary components and features and it’s inconvenient navigating through it all. With our site, we want to offer a more simplistic and minimal looking site so that it just includes just the important information about clubs such as description, mission, contact information, and social media pages. It’s something freshman, transfer, and even new graduate students can all benefit from. Overall, we just want to make the search for clubs here at UCSB much easier for people.
# Home Page
Upon start up the home page displays our project mission, and just below that we have club bubbles that display all the clubs here on campus. (add club image here) <br />
To browse all the clubs you can scroll further down until you find a club you likem click it, and you will be redirected to the club page.
# Login 
Our website can be used without the Login feature; however, in order to access some features like bookmarks, comments, reviews, and profile page, you can look at the navigation bar at the top seen here: (add image) <br />
