# Product Purpose
For many students at UCSB, it's difficult to find their community here in college. Especially since it’s a new environment far away from home. There isn’t a central repository of information about UCSB clubs so we thought creating a site like this could really benefit a lot of people. Shoreline is a common way of finding clubs here at Ucsb, but it has a lot of unnecessary components and features and it’s inconvenient navigating through it all. With our site, we want to offer a more simplistic and minimal looking site so that it just includes just the important information about clubs such as description, mission, contact information, and social media pages. It’s something freshman, transfer, and even new graduate students can all benefit from. Overall, we just want to make the search for clubs here at UCSB much easier for people.
