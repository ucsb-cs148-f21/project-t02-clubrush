# Project Specifics
Front end: <br />
- We have implemented a login system so that the user can login and see their user profile and bookmark clubs they find interesting. The login feature also allows for users to leave comments under a club page.
- We have implemented a system for students to leave reviews or comments for clubs so that other users may see how others think about clubs on campus.
- We have implemented a search bar and dropdown that shows clubs, searching by club name or club categories.
- We have implemented club bubbles on the homepage that display all the clubs and are clickable and will take the user to the respective club page.
- We're doing this using React. <br />

Back end: <br />
- We data scraped Shoreline using puppeteer and have loaded all the data into MongoDB, and our website retrieves all this data from the database and displays all the club pages. It also allows for the user to create a new user account and load it into MongoDB.<br />


Database: <br />
- This database stores all the club info that was data scraped from Shoreline, including the club name, image, banner, links, club description, the way the clubs are categorized, and user data like: ID, email, comments, and bookmarks .<br />


User Authentication: <br />
- We have implemented a system so that once the user logs in, they can bookmark clubs and leave comments under a club page, and also view their personal information on a profile page, like bookmarks and user info.
