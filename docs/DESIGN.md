For this website we have created our own API by data scraping Shoreline and integrating all that data into our own website in a more user friendly experience. <br />

# Project Specifics
Front end: <br />
- We will implement a login system so that the user can login and see their user profile and sign up for club events and see events on their calendar.
- We have implemented a system for students to leave reviews for clubs so that other users may see how others think about clubs on campus.
- We have implemented a search bar and dropdown that shows clubs
- We have implemented Club bubbles on the homepage that show all the clubs and are clickable and will take the user to the respective club page.
