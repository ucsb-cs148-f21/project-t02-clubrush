# Project Specifics
Front end: <br />
- We will implement a login system so that the user can login and see their user profile and sign up for club events and see events on their calendar. 
- We have implemented a system for students to leave reviews for clubs so that other users may see how others think about clubs on campus.
- We have implemented a search bar and dropdown that shows clubs
- We have implemented Club bubbles on the homepage that show all the clubs and are clickable and will take the user to the respective club page.
- We're doing this using React. <br />

Back end: <br />
- We data scraped Shoreline using Python and have loaded all the data into MongoDB, and our website retrieves all this data from the database and displays all the club pages. <br />


Database: <br />
- This database stores all the club info that was data scraped from Shoreline, including the club name, image, banner, links, club description, and the way its categorized. <br />


User Authentication: <br />
- We will implement a system so that once the User logs in, they can bookmark clubs and also add club events to their personal calendar.
