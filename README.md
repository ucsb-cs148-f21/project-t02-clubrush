# Project Name
Club Rush
# Description
Our project will allow students to find at community at UCSB in a more streamlined website that is more convenient than the current website, Shoreline.

For our project, we want to utilize filters and nested drop-down menus, to give students an easier time in their search for their new community. We want to have broader categories displayed first such as academic, fraternity, cultural, community service, etc., and then within those individual categories, have more specific filters to match what the user is looking for in their search: Co-ed, engineering, Asian, etc. We want this site to be as minimal and simplistic as possible to give students an easier time in their search. Sites such as Shoreline is a good option too, but Shoreline has too much unneccessary information and most organization's  page on Shoreline has not been updated in a very long time.

# Tech Stack
For our project, we will be using the MERN stack development. MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js

# Communication + Meetings
We are holding meetings and checkouts remotely over Discord, and frequently contacting our team memebers to see how much we've done or if we have any questions for the others.
# User Roles
Our Club Rush application would have Users that are students who can search up organizations, but can't add new information/data to the system. We would also have Admin/Organization Leaders that could upload new data to the system that would update organization info that is displayed on the app.

# Installation
# Prerequisites
TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which version(s) of your framework(s) of choice)

# Dependencies
TODO: List which libraries / add-ons you added to the project, and the purpose each of those add-ons serves in your app.

# Installation Steps
TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you give complete instructions to get your project going from scratch). Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. Note that with the use of GitHub Actions, these instructions can eventually be fully automated (e.g. with act, you can run GitHub Actions locally).

# Functionality
TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section, and showcase your features.

# Known Problems
TODO: Describe any known issues, bugs, odd behaviors or code smells. Provide steps to reproduce the problem and/or name a file or a function where the problem lives.
