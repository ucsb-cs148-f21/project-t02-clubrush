# Project Name
Club Rush
# Description
Our project will allow students to find at community at UCSB in a more streamlined website that is more convenient than the current website, Shoreline.

For our project, we want to utilize filters and nested drop-down menus, to give students an easier time in their search for their new community. We want to have broader categories displayed first such as academic, fraternity, cultural, community service, etc., and then within those individual categories, have more specific filters to match what the user is looking for in their search: Co-ed, engineering, Asian, etc. We want this site to be as minimal and simplistic as possible to give students an easier time in their search. Sites such as Shoreline is a good option too, but Shoreline has too much unneccessary information and most organization's  page on Shoreline has not been updated in a very long time.

# Tech Stack
For our project, we will be using the MERN stack development. MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js

# Communication + Meetings
We are holding meetings and checkouts remotely over Discord, and frequently contacting our team memebers to see how much we've done or if we have any questions for the others.
# User Roles
Our Club Rush application would have Users that are students who can search up organizations, but can't add new information/data to the system. We would also have Admin/Organization Leaders that could upload new data to the system that would update organization info that is displayed on the app.
